# High Score Node Demo

## Overview
The High Score Node Demo allows users to submit their high scores along with their name and state. This project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js with Express for the backend, storing data in a JSON file.

Please note that while we are learning how to work with a JSON file in class, you would need a full database to create an effective, fullstack application.
